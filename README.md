# Unsteady-State-Heat-Transfer-Modeling-of-a-Baking-Bread-in-an-Oven-with-MATLAB

This project presents a detailed unsteady state heat transfer model of bread baking in an oven, implemented using MATLAB. The study focuses on simulating the thermal behavior of bread as it undergoes the baking process, where the temperature distribution within the bread changes over time. the goal of this project is to find the moving bread rail's speed to keep the bread's average temperature at certain amount to get baked.

This unsteady heat transfer model incorporates the transient heat conduction equation, along with some sensible boundary conditions to simulate the heat exchange between the oven and the bread surface. The governing equations are solved numerically using finite difference methods, enabling the prediction of temperature profiles within the bread over time. This model aids in understanding the dynamic temperature gradients that influence bread quality and baking time. MATLABâ€™s computational tools are leveraged to visualize the heat distribution and provide insights into the thermal processes involved.

This repository contains all the MATLAB code, detailed explanations, and visualizations needed for the model, making it a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and students interested in heat transfer modeling and baking process simulation.
