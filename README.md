# Unsteady State Heat Transfer Modeling of a Baking Bread in an Oven with MATLAB

## Overview

This project presents a sophisticated mathematical model and numerical simulation of the heat transfer process in bread baking. The model considers a unique setup where a loaf of bread moves at a constant speed along a circular rail, with half of the rail inside an oven and half outside, exposing the bread to varying temperature conditions.

The primary objective of this study is to determine the optimal radial velocity of the rail that maintains the bread's average temperature at a specific level for proper baking. This complex problem is approached through unsteady state heat transfer modeling, implemented and visualized using MATLAB.

Key aspects of the project include:

1. Development of a mathematical model for the heat transfer process in a moving bread loaf
2. Implementation of numerical methods (Crank-Nicolson and finite difference) to solve the governing partial differential equations
3. Optimization of the rail's radial velocity to achieve desired baking conditions
4. Visualization and analysis of the temperature distribution within the bread over time

The project demonstrates the application of advanced heat transfer principles, numerical methods, and computational techniques in solving a practical food engineering problem.

This project showcases advanced capabilities in heat transfer modeling, numerical methods, and scientific computing, demonstrating proficiency in applying theoretical knowledge to practical engineering problems.
